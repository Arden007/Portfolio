                <p>
                  During my tenure at BCX, I had the opportunity to work in
                  different roles within the company. Initially, I served as a
                  technician for 4 months, where I honed my technical skills.
                  Subsequently, I transitioned to the logistics department and
                  worked as a storeman in the dispatch and receive department
                  for 8 months. However, after a year of working, I realized
                  that the work was not providing me with the level of challenge
                  and fulfillment I sought. It was then that I made the pivotal
                  decision to pursue coding and immerse myself in the world of
                  technology. My passion for technology and the desire for a
                  more challenging career led me to embark on my coding journey.
                  Through my experiences at BCX and the realization of my true
                  passion for coding, I am now dedicated to building a
                  successful career in the technology industry. I am excited
                  about the possibilities and eager to continue growing as a
                  skilled and motivated professional in the field of software
                  development.

                  I completed a six-month internship with Lifechoices Academy
                  after graduating as a Full Stack Developer. During the
                  internship, I expanded my skillset by learning SQL with
                  Postgres, Knex, Jest testing, Figma, website development with
                  WordPress and SEO, and a foundational understanding of PHP.
                  This valuable experience allowed me to apply my knowledge in
                  practical scenarios and equipped me with a diverse range of
                  technical abilities as a Full Stack Developer. I am eager to
                  leverage these skills in contributing to meaningful projects
